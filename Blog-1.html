                  When you think of robots and movies, you probably think of I, Robot, Wall-E, or the Terminator. Or, you may think of the more realistic robots in movies, like the industrial robot that continually sprayed Tony Stark with a fire extinguisher in Iron Man. 
                  However, industrial robots are not just working in movies in Hollywood, they are also helping to make movies.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Robots have started to pair with directors in Hollywood to assist in the movie making process. Think about those scenes where shots have to be steady and there is a requirement to move around in a scene while shooting. 
                  What’s better than a robot to hold the camera? That was one of the many duties of robots that helped to make the movie Gravity in the year 2013.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The movie Gravity relied heavily on industrial robots that were originally designed to perform assembly, welding, and painting application. Instead of being fitted with welding guns and other industrial tooling, the end-of-arm tooling items for these robots were cameras, lights, props, and even the actors. 
                  This was especially important when there was a need to shoot the parts of the film where the actors were rolling through space uncontrollably. With the help of the robot arms, the crew was able to pull off remarkable shots that made the tumbling into the vastness of space look so realistic. 
                  By using robots behind the scenes, the director was able to set a new standard of moving making in Hollywood.
                </p>


                <p>
                  Industrial robots can perform a variety of applications, like those mentioned above, as well as pick and place, packaging, dispensing, and material removal applications. Robots can achieve a level of precision, speed and coordination of movement which cannot be matched by humans. Lights, props, explosions, special effects, and even the positions of the actors, all can be synchronized to the millisecond and coordinated with sound and playback.
                  Robots are redefining the film industry by assisting movie directors in the process of film making.
                </p>

                <h3>A LITTLE FLASHBACK OF FILM MAKING.</h3>
                <p>
                  Earlier, when someone wished to shoot a film, they had to first collect a huge chunk of money for paying their employees to perform jobs which included preparing the whole set for shooting, building the props that would be used in the movie, setting up the cameras for filming, focusing the camera at a particular angle that’s needed for the filming process and building dolly tracks, etc. 
                  All this sounds like a lot of work! But this was just the initial phase for making of the film.
                </p>


                <h3>REDEFINING THE FILM INDUSTRY WITH ROBOTS</h3>
                <p>
                  Manually setting up cameras for shooting a film is a tedious task which requires lots of work and precision. 
                  The angle of the camera should be ‘fixed’ or ‘moving’ depending on the requirement of the film shoot. 
                  This angle shouldn’t be disturbed by the movement.  Besides, the production team has to set up the dolly track and push it manually as required, which is again very burdensome. 
                  Now, imagine, what if robots perform all of these tasks for us? Incredible, right? We have robots that are programmed to work as per the operator, making slow or swift motions with cameras, depending on the requirement. 
                  These robots potentially eliminate the need for human workers, thereby performing every task precisely by themselves and automating the shooting process. Additionally, the set designers are burdened with a lot of responsibilities, including designing creative designs, along with meeting high level precision, fulfilling the increasing demand for designs, and delivering the design within the time allotted. 
                  Performing all of this is practically very time consuming and difficult for them. The good news is that the new-age designers need not worry about all this anymore. As we know that robots are programmable machines that can perform such tasks, set designers can use robots since they cannot only print 3D models but also carve the designs for them. 
                  Cool, right? It is true that modern technologies never leave a chance to amaze us. But, we must say, the way robots are impressing us is outstanding. 
                  Robots are certainly revolutionizing the film industry.
